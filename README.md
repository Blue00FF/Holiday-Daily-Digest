# Holiday-Daily-Digest
The aim of this project is to create a program that uses a Calendarific API to get Digest: information about holidays around the world, look for the ones that are being celebrated on the day and send an email to the user containing this information.

To use it, you must register for a free account on both Calendarific to get an API and on mailtrap to get credentials and see the email received without needing a sender account and a receiver account.
